# Web3-Refund-by-Location-Smart-Contract
This repository is a web3 project using ethereum blockchain to develop a web3 dApp that has a smart contract tested and deployed in a testnet and a front end that will allow monitoring of the  account status.

## Project overview
### Problem
Most companies send their staff to work remotely or represent the company on business trips, seminars and other official occasions. At such a time the employee requires some funding or reimbursement for costs incurred during the work trip. Currently, companies rely on the word of their employee that they were in the work location or used the facility agreed on with the company. The employee could have not been in the said location or cheated their way to getting reimbursement yet no costs were actually incurred.
### Solution
The refund by location smart contract is aimed to be used when one party, for example an employer, agrees to pay another party, for example an employee, for being present in a certain geographic area for a certain duration. The employee's phone sends their GPS location to a smart contract at a certain interval. Based on the pre-agreed contract codified in an Ethereum smart contract, a cryptocurrency payment is executed when all the agreed conditions are met.
If, at any point, the GPS sensor indicates that the employee is outside the range of the agreed GPS area, the contract state will be updated to indicate that it is out of compliance.
